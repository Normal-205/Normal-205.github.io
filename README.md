# My First Website 
Following the successful conclusion of our charity campaign, we have taken the necessary steps to ensure transparency and accountability in all our financial undertakings. To this end, my friend visited our bank to complete the official bank statement procedures, which include a detailed transaction history of our charity account. In the spirit of complete openness, we have uploaded the bank statement to our website using the Adobe PDF Embed API, which allows our supporters and stakeholders to view the document directly on the webpage. This action reaffirms our commitment to uphold the highest standards of financial integrity and to share the outcome of our campaign with the community that made it possible.
